# Romey Designs

## Deployment
We're using S3 so you need to set some environment variables to get things rolling.  We use env vars because the end deployment idea is heroku.

You'll need S3_ACCESS_KEY, S3_SECRET and S3_BUCKET


## Running tests
Set environment variables ROMEY_ADMIN_USER and ROMEY_ADMIN_PASS both to 'whatever' to test authorization.
